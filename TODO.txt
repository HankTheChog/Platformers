Working
-------
players can move (wasd keys, and arrow keys move players)
rope can be toggled (tab or right control)


Working, but should be polished
--------------------------------
rope pulls players towards one another. their movement in this case depends on rope elasiticty and their
   ground friction. we should play with those parameters to make it good.

as an experiment, I also make the rope push players when they're too close (like a spring).
   to change this, look for 'experiment' in Rope.cs

when landing from jump, player doesn't have momentum. this feels weird.
jumps should have more momentum after long run - this effect happens now, but very lightly.

TODO
----
rope should restrict players movements.
players should be able to turn into platforms.
camera should follow players (their center of mass).
prevent players from getting too far from one another - they must both be visible at all times.
add indications/animations when running/jumping.
