Working
-------
players can move (wasd keys, and arrow keys move players)
rope can be toggled (tab or right control)


Working, but should be polished
--------------------------------
when landing from jump, player doesn't have momentum. this feels weird.
jumps should have more momentum after long run - this effect happens now, but very lightly.

TODO
----
rope should restrict players movements.
players should be able to turn into platforms.
camera should follow players (their center of mass).
prevent players from getting too far from one another - they must both be visible at all times.
add indications/animations when running/jumping.
